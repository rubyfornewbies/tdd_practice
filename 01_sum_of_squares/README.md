# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

 ```ruby
 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 3851
 ```
 The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

 ```ruby
 (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
 ```
 Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
 ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

 Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
 one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
 find the difference of each
